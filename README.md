# Anti-Climax - the MCG
This is Anti-Climax - a short and silly MCG (Multiple-Choice Game) where the user is presented two choices, and can either choose the right answer and proceed... or die.

Story inspired and generated with [InferKit demo](https://app.inferkit.com/demo) (previously talktotransformer.com).

Made with vanilla JS and HTML/CSS.
