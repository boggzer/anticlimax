                You hear a strange noise coming from the kitchen. At first, you
                think it's a joke. But then somebody else inside the kitchen starts to scream...

                There's a figure standing there, holding a very scary looking weapon in its hands. Hold on, you
                recognize this figure!<br>'Thomas, ya big ol' creeper!' Yes, it was indeed Thomas. He kills you with one
                hit. A true anti-climax.

                'Sing Placebo song for me, yes', the creature says.

                Unable to perform a Placebo serenade to the hellish creature, it growls, 'I want Placebo!'. It kills
