                You hear a strange noise coming from the kitchen. At first, you
                think it's a joke. But then somebody else inside the kitchen starts to scream...
            </p>
            <p class="path-one-death display-none">
                There's a figure standing there, holding a very scary looking weapon in its hands. Hold on, you
                recognize this figure!<br>'Thomas, ya big ol' creeper!' Yes, it was indeed Thomas. He kills you with one
                hit. A true anti-climax.

                Falling back to sleep, you hear the scream again, this time more gut-wrenching than before! There's some
                kind of an animal here! How are we supposed to know it's one of the creatures from hell?
            </p>
            <p class="path-two-death display-none">
                The creature shouts in pain and turns to a bloody puddle of flesh and bones.<br>Oh no, this is not the
                final ending. You're going to have to try harder than that.

                'Placebo?', the creature mumbles 'I l-love Placebo'. 'Why, yes of course!', you reply, a few drops of
                sweat on your forehead.
                'Sing Placebo song for me, yes', the creature says.
            </p>
            <p class="path-three-death display-none">
                Unable to perform a Placebo serenade to the hellish creature, it growls, 'I want Placebo!'. It kills
                you. You better learn the lyrics until next time!
            </p>
            <p class="the-end display-none">
                The creature hums happily as he is... sung to sleep! Well, that was easy. And that's the whole story. Anti-climax.<br>
                The End.
